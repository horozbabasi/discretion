# PrivacyShield

Local-first PII detection and masking.

> **Status: milestone M1.** This README is a placeholder; it gets written properly at M11.

Monorepo layout:

- `packages/core` — detection pipeline library (M1: shared types, script detection, Stage 0 normalization with an exact bidirectional offset map)
- `packages/data` — generated Unicode data (M1: confusables table)
- `packages/eval` — evaluation harness (placeholder)
- `packages/extension` — browser extension (placeholder)
- `packages/web` — web playground (placeholder)

## Development

The library targets Node 20+ (`engines`). Development uses the version pinned
in `.nvmrc` (24.18.0).

```sh
npm install
npm run build      # tsc project-references build
npm test           # vitest (unit + property + fuzz)
npm run lint
npm run bench      # normalization throughput benchmark
```

### Regenerating the Unicode confusables table

`packages/data/src/confusables.ts` is generated and **committed**, so neither
the build nor the runtime ever touches the network. Regeneration is a
deliberate, occasional step:

```bash
npm run generate -w @privacyshield/data
```

This **fetches over the network** from
<https://www.unicode.org/Public/security/latest/confusables.txt>, and requires
Node 22.6+ for native TypeScript type stripping (the `.nvmrc` version
satisfies this; Node 20 does not). Set `CONFUSABLES_URL` to override the
source — a numbered version directory once Unicode publishes one for this
release, or a local file for offline regeneration.

The generated module records the Unicode version and the **SHA-256 of the
source bytes** it consumed. Unicode serves the current release from
`latest/` before publishing a numbered directory for it, so there is no
stable versioned URL to pin; the digest is the pin. Re-run the generator and
compare `CONFUSABLES_SOURCE_SHA256` to detect upstream drift.

## Licensing

`"private": true`.
